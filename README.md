# slackrc
Post notifications from IRC to Slack

# Work In Progress

Joins, and then listens for privmsgs. Sends privmsgs to slack directly.

Helps me maintain my workflow with Slack. Because emacs modes for Slack are still under progress,
I thought of this easier approach where a bot logs in to a few channels and listens to them for me
and notifies me on Slack upon update.
